# Machine-Learning-Made-Simple

## A full road-map from machine learning to deep learning

### Machine Learning

1. Machine Learning course offered by Stanford
   * Taught by best instructor - Andrew Ng
   * Covers all the important algorithms in a very simple way.
   
   Note: Excercises are in octave, so if you wish you can copy-paste the solution of excercises, but don't blindly copy-paste, try to          understand the problem as well as its solution. In future when you will learn python for ML, you can solve the same problem in python.      Solutions are available online.
   
2. Machine Learning with Python offered by IBM
   * First exposure to practical machine learning.
   * Covers all the important machine learning libraries - Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Sckit-Learn.
   
3. To learn libraries more comprensively, follow this resource.

* Numpy : For this you can refer to [official quickstart tutorial of numpy](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html).
   
* Pandas : Read the below topics from [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/).

4. Machine Learning Specialization offered by University Of Washington
   * This specialization covers all the algorithms in greater details, having a single full course for a particular kind of algorithm.

5. Solve Titanic and House prediction problem on kaggle.

6. Pick up any project and do it.

### Deep Learning

1. Deep Learning Specialization offered by deeplearning.ai
   * Taught by Andrew Ng.
   * This specialization starts from very basic and covers CNN and sequence models.
   * Teaches keras and tensorflow library at a basic level.

    Note: 3rd course of this specialization is not important for now. You can skip it.
    
2. Practical Deep Learning for Coders offered by fast.ai
   * Taught by Jeremy Howard.
   * Best course to make your hands dirty with code.
   * This course follows top-down aproach, it will first teach you how to code deep learning model and then deep dive into the      fundamentals.
   * This course will motivate you to do different kinds of projects.
   * Uses fastai library (Build on top of pytorch library).

    Note: This course is the part-1. There is part-2 also which covers fundamentals.

3. To learn libraries more comprensively, follow this resource.
* Keras - Follow the official [documentation](https://keras.io/).
* Tensorflow - Follow the official [documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
