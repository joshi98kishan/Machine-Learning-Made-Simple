# Machine-Learning-Made-Simple

## A full road-map from machine learning to deep learning

1. Machine Learning course offered by Stanford
   * Taught by best instructor - Andrew Ng
   * Covers all the important algorithms in a very simple way.
   
   Note: Excercises are in octave, so if you wish you can copy-paste the solution of excercises, but don't blindly copy-paste, try to        understand the problem as well as its solution. In future when you will learn python for ML, you can solve the same problem in python.    Solutions are available online.
   
2. Machine Learning with Python offered by IBM
   * First exposure to practical machine learning.
   * Covers all the important machine learning libraries.
   
3. Python Data Science Handbook
   Now read this book. Read the chapters on numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and sklearn. Try to skim through the chapters fastly.
   
4. Machine Learning Specialization offered by University Of Washington
