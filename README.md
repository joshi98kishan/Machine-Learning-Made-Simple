# Machine-Learning-Made-Simple

## A full road-map from Machine Learning to Deep Learning

### Machine Learning

1. [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course offered by Stanford :
   * Taught by one of the best instructor in the industry - Andrew Ng
   * Covers all the important algorithms in a very simple way.
   
   Note: Excercises are in octave, so if you wish you can copy-paste the solution of excercises, but don't blindly copy-paste, try to          understand the problem as well as its solution. In future when you will learn python for ML, you can solve the same problem in python. Solutions are available online.

2. Before going ahead and learn python for machine learning, you should know about [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).
   You can understand Anaconda as a single software which is packed up with all the libraries required for data science. So, you don't need to install all the libraries seperately, you just need to install Anaconda and all the required libraraies for ML will come up with it. Also libraries which are not pre-installed with Anaconda can be easily installed with its package manager (i.e. Conda).
   
   Read this blog - [An introduction to Anaconda: what it is, and how to install it](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-install-anaconda-on-ubuntu-16-04-64-bit-6f1c4675ce44/)
   
   Now install the Anaconda in your pc.
   For installation, you can follow the [official documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).
   
   Also read this blog for Jupyter Notebook - [Jupyter Notebook: An Introduction](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/). Dont need to read it fully, just have a basic idea. Jupyter Notebook come up with Anaconda, so you don't need to install it seperately.
  
3. [Machine Learning with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/) offered by IBM :
   * First exposure to practical machine learning.
   * Covers all the important machine learning libraries in brief - Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Sckit-Learn.

3. To learn libraries more comprehensively, follow this resources :

* Numpy : For this you can refer to [official quickstart tutorial of numpy](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html).
   
* Pandas : Read the below topics from [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/).
           Chapter 3 - [Data Manipulation with Pandas](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.00-introduction-to-pandas.html) :

    - [Aggregation and Grouping](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.08-aggregation-and-grouping.html)
            
* Matplotlib - Read the below topics from [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/).Chapter 4 - [Visualization with Matplotlib](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/04.00-introduction-to-matplotlib.html) :

    - [Simple Line Plots](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/04.01-simple-line-plots.html)
    - [Simple Scatter Plots](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/04.02-simple-scatter-plots.html)

4. Machine Learning Specialization offered by University Of Washington
   * This specialization covers all the algorithms in greater details, having a single full course for a particular kind of algorithm.

5. Solve [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) and [House Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) problem on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

6. Now select the datasets from two most famous data repositories - [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and [UC Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). And solve the problem.

### Deep Learning

1. [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) offered by deeplearning.ai
   * Taught by Andrew Ng.
   * This specialization starts from very basic and covers CNN and Sequence Models.
   * Teaches Keras and Tensorflow library at a basic level.

    Note: 3rd course of this specialization is not important for now. You can skip it.
    
2. [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) offered by fast.ai
   * Taught by Jeremy Howard.
   * Best course to make your hands dirty with code.
   * This course follows top-down aproach, it will first teach you how to code deep learning model and then deep dive into the      fundamentals.
   * This course will motivate you to do different kinds of projects.
   * Uses fastai library (Build on top of pytorch library).

    Note: This course is the part-1. There is [part-2](https://course.fast.ai/part2) also which covers fundamentals.

3. To learn libraries more comprehensively, follow this resources :
* Keras - Follow the official [documentation](https://keras.io/).
* Pytorch - Follow the official [documentation](https://pytorch.org/).
* Tensorflow - Follow the official [documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

4. Solve [Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) on on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

5. Now select the datasets from two most famous data repositories - [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and [UC Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). And solve the problem.
