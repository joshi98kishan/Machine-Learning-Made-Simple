# Machine-Learning-Made-Simple

## A full road-map from machine learning to deep learning

1. Machine Learning course offered by Stanford
   * Taught by best instructor - Andrew Ng
   * Covers all the important algorithms in a very simple way.
   
   Note: Excercises are in octave, so if you wish you can copy-paste the solution of excercises, but don't blindly copy-paste, try to          understand the problem as well as its solution. In future when you will learn python for ML, you can solve the same problem in python.      Solutions are available online.
   
2. Machine Learning with Python offered by IBM
   * First exposure to practical machine learning.
   * Covers all the important machine learning libraries - Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Sckit-Learn.
   
3. To learn libraries more comprensively, follow this resource.

* Numpy : For this you can refer to [official quickstart tutorial of numpy](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html).
   
* Pandas : Read the below topics from [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/).

4. Machine Learning Specialization offered by University Of Washington
   * This specialization covers all the algorithms in greater details, having a single full corse for a particular kind of algorithm.
   * One disadvantage of this specialization is that it uses GraphLab library.
